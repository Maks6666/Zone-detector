# Zone Detection

## Introduction
Zone Detection is a project aimed at predicting the location of events in videos based on objects detected by the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) neural network. The custom Tensorflow-model identifies specific zones such as roads, airports, and pedestrian zones where events might occur.

## Features
- Utilizes YOLO for object detection.
- Predicts event locations based on detected objects.
- Supports multiple event zones: roads, airports, and pedestrian zones.
- Provides flexibility for customizing and extending the model.
